# Customer Behavior Data Analyst Portfolio Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow, from data acquisition and cleaning to visualization and reporting. The goal is to analyze customer behavior data, extract actionable insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present findings in a professional report and presentation.  

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Brief description of dataset source, e.g., Kaggle, company data, open data portal]  
- **Description:** The dataset contains [number] records and [number] features, including customer demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics.  
- **Format:** CSV / Excel / Database tables  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- **SQL:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server for querying and data manipulation  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard creation for insights visualization  
- **Gamma:** Professional presentation creation  
- **Other:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

## Steps
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded the dataset using Python.  
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.  
   - Performed feature engineering for better analysis.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Generated summary statistics and visualizations.  
   - Identified patterns, trends, and outliers in customer behavior.  

3. **SQL Queries**  
   - Imported cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server.  
   - Executed queries to extract aggregated insights, perform joins, and filter data for analysis.  

4. **Dashboard Creation**  
   - Developed a Power BI dashboard with key metrics, trends, and interactive filters.  
   - Visualizations include sales trends, customer segmentation, retention analysis, and KPIs.  

5. **Reporting & Presentation**  
   - Created a detailed report summarizing analysis, insights, and recommendations.  
   - Designed a presentation in Gamma to highlight key findings for stakeholders.  

## Dashboard
- **Key metrics visualized:** sales trends, purchase frequency, customer segmentation, retention rates  
- **Interactive features:** slicers, filters, drill-throughs  
- **Screenshot/Link (optional):** [Insert if applicable]  

## Results
- Extracted actionable insights on customer purchase behavior and engagement.  
- Identified trends, correlations, and anomalies to support business decision-making.  
- Presented findings in an accessible and visual format for stakeholders.
